                            In days when Nice was ruled by noble families and stern tradition, there lived 
                            a young woman named <span class="highlight">Estelle Beaumont</span>. 
                            As the single daughter, she belonged to Lord Beaumont, the powerful merchant who 
                            controlled the lavender trade along the Mediterranean coast.

                            Estelle was said to be of legendary beauty, but her heart yearned for something 
                            more than the golden cage of her father's estate.

                                Afraid of rivals and thieves, her father had assigned her a bodyguard to watch

                                a strong young man from the farming villages in the mountains, who comported 
                                himself with quiet dignity despite his humble origins.

                                But fate has a cruel sense of timing. Lord Beaumont had arranged for Estelle to 
                                be married to the son of a duke from Marseille. When she refused, her father 
                                locked her in the tower of his estate.

                                Matthieu, desperate and foolish with love, one stormy night, came to free her. 
                                The guards caught him climbing the wall of the tower. Infuriated, Lord Beaumont 
                                ordered Matthieu to be executed at dawn.

                                Estelle watched from her window, screaming until her voice was hoarse, while her

                                heart, though servants whispered she'd willed herself to join Matthieu.

                                A hundred years later, a farmer bought the land between the lakes. Two cows were 
                                born on the same night, one with markings like midnight sky, the other with a 
                                white star on her forehead. These cows were inseparable, always grazing side by 
                                side, always resting under the same tree.
                            </p>

                                When one died of old age, the other followed within a day. This pattern repeated 
                                for generations: two cows, always together, always dying within days of each other.
